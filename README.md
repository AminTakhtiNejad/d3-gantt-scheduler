# d3-gantt-scheduler

Demo where you can:
- Add timeslots for a specific task (timeslot start at rounded minute, duration is minute multiple and 1 minute minumum between 2 slots). 
- Timeslots start date & duration are relatives to a global start date which could be changed on the fly.
- Timeslots could be moved, enlarged/reduced and removed by dblclick, impossible to move them before start date or if it breaks previous rules. 
- Timeslots are relative to a start date which could be changed on the fly.
- Shift timeline by 'click & move' and zoom/unzoom using mouse wheel (or with bottom buttons).  
- 'Auto build' button to add one timeslot of one minute per task spaced by a minute.
